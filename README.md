Close
 
The close scenario will have a map of 125th St, one of the most dangerous arterial roads in the city, showing where all injuries and fatalities have occurred since 2010.

 
Middle
 
The middle scenario will add features that facilitate greater interaction with the data, such as a zoom function that would zoom in to the exact junction/location in each instance. It would also include social media buttons for Facebook and twitter.


Reach
 
The reach scenario would add additional functionality, including links to three live NY DOT traffic surveillance cameras located along 125th St at Broadway, St. Nicholas Ave and 2nd Ave. It would also include a hover function that would bring up a photograph and the name and age of the victim in each of the fatal cases along 125th St since 2010.
